# Consideraciones
At the start of the script there is a variable called `filename`, this variable must be equal to the path of the `expanded` file contained in the zip file. This file is used instead of the `.data` file to obtain better plots. If the `.data` file needs to be used, change the `edible\_class` to `e` and the `poisonous\_class` to `p` and the `filename` accordingly.
